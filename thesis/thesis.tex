Maximum flow problem has been a very important optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. This problem has a lot of practical relevance.
Some of the age-old applications involving maximum flow have been in electrical circuits, water supply networks, etc. With the advent of social media
and social networks, this problem has found a newer practical relevance. And since the graphs in these networks are typically very large,
researchers are sought after creating faster and more efficient algorithms for this problem. \\

Some of the classical algorithms to solve this problem are the Ford-Fulkerson's augmenting path algorithm and the Dinic's Algorithm. These algorithms
compute the exact value of the maximum flow. It is also fairly straightforward to obtain the optimal flow vector after the termination of the
algorithm. The main drawback with this algorithm is that the running time, though polynomial, is very high and is expensive to use in many practical
situations. Following these algorithms a series of push-relabel algorithms were devised which had a slightly better running time as compared to the 
classical algorithms. The series of algorithms terminated with the algorithm by Goldberg-Rao which gave a O($m^{\frac{3}{2}}$)-time algorithm. For 
extremely large graphs, as in the case of social networks, this algorithm is still far from being practical. \\

In 2008, the breakthrough result by Spielman and Teng gave an algorithm to solve the Symetric Diagonally Dominant(SDD) system of equations in 
near-linear time. This work was immediately extended by Koutis-Miller-Peng which gave an efficient algorithm to produce an incremental graph sparsifier.
Developement of these techniquies led to the developement of an almost linear time algorithm to the maximum flow problem by Cristiano-Kelner-Madry-Spielman-Teng.
This involved looking at the graph as a resistive network, approximating the electrical flow and producing an approximate s-t flow from this approximate
electrical flow. This algorithm broke the running time barrier of Golderg-Rao and gave the first almost-linear time algorithm. \\

In this thesis, we give a survey of the above algorithms for the maximum flow problem. We first start off by giving a brief description of the 
classical algorithms. We then conclude this by giving a completely recursive specification for the push-relabel algorithm.
We then present the required tools from spectral graph theory and linear algebra that is required to understand the almost linear 
time algorithm. Finally, we present the Cristiano-Kelner-Madry-Spielman-Teng algorithm in detail. We will also present some of the key theorems from the 
Koutis-Miller-Peng SDD solver. Finally, we give some arguments to justify the requirement of the weight updates and also show some steps that can possibly
lead to making the algorithm parallel.\\

 \chapter{INTRODUCTION}
 \label{chap:intro}
    Maximum-Flow problem is an age old optmization problem in mathematics and computer science. Hundreds of researchers have investigated this problem
    and have given some interesting results. This problem has far-reaching applications in almost every field of engineering and sciences. Hence, this 
    problem is of great importance, not just theoretically, but also in real-world applications. Hence, getting better and more efficient algorithms
    for this problem and its variants has always been the pursuit. Inspite, of having had so much research into this problem, for many years we were far from getting an algorithm
    that runs in time that is good for practical purposes. This gives an indication of the hardness of this problem.
    
    \section{Basics}
      \subsubsection{Graph}
      A \textit{graph} G($V$, $E$, $\rho$) is defined as a mathematical structure on the set of vertices $V$ and the set of edges $E$ and an adjacency
      function $\rho : V \times V \rightarrow E$, such that $\rho(a,b) = e$ for $a,b \in V$ and $e \in E$ tells that there exists an edge $e$ between 
      the vertices $a$ and $b$.
      
      \subsubsection{Undirected Graph}
	An \textit{undirected graph} is a graph where the function $\rho$ is symmetric, i.e. $\rho(a,b) = \rho(b,a)$.
 
      \subsubsection{Directed Graph}
	An \textit{directed graph} is a graph where the function $\rho$ is not necessarily a symmetric function.
	
      \subsubsection{Capacitated Graph}
	A \textit{capacitated graph} is a graph defined as G($V$, $E$, $\rho$, $\psi$), where the first three values in the tuple mean the same as before.
	The $\psi$ in the definition is a function $\psi: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which assigns a real number corresponding to every edge $e$ in the 
	graph. This real number is called the \textit{capacity} of the graph.
      
      \subsubsection{s-t Flow}
	A \textit{s-t flow} is a vector $f \in \mathbb{R}^{|E|}$ such that the following two criteria hold:
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item 
	   Flow Conservation: $$\displaystyle\sum_{e \in E^+(v)} f(e)- \displaystyle\sum_{e \in E^-(v)} f(e) = 0 ~~~~~ \forall v \in V \setminus \{s,t\}$$
	   where $E^-(v)$ denotes the set $\{a: \rho(a,v) \text{ is defined}\}$ and $E^+(v)$ denotes the set $\{a: \rho(v,a) \text{ is defined}\}$
	 \item
	  Capacity maintanence:
	    $$f(e) \leq \psi(e)~~~~~\forall e \in E$$
	      
	\end{itemize}
	
	Additionally, the \textit{value} of the flow $f$ is a real number $F$ such that,
	$$|f| = F = \displaystyle\sum_{e \in E^+(s)} f(e)- \displaystyle\sum_{e \in E^-(s)} f(e)$$
	
      \section{Maximum Flow Problem}
	Given a capacitated graph G($V$, $E$, $\rho$, $\psi$), a source vertex s and a sink vertex t, the goal of the problem is to find a s-t flow
	such that the value of the flow is maximised among all possible s-t flows. \\
	
	\subsection{Simple Linear Program definition}
	  This problem can be posed as a linear programming problem. The advantages of this are more than just being able to solve LP's efficiently.
	  The dual of this LP has a very interesting interpretation in graph theory. 
	  
	  $$\max \displaystyle\sum_{u:(s,u) \in E} f((s,u))$$
	  subject to
	  \begin{itemize}
	   \item
	      $\forall v \in V \setminus \{s,t\}$ $\displaystyle\sum_{(u,v) \in E} f((u,v))$ = $\displaystyle\sum_{(v,w) \in E} f((v,w))$
	   \item
	      $\forall (u,v) \in E$ $f((u,v)) \leq c((u,v))$
	   \item
	      $\forall(u,v) \in E$ $f((u,v)) \geq 0$
	      
	  \end{itemize}
	  
	  Note that a tuple (a, b) represents an edge e whose end points are a and b. \\
	  
	  Clearly, the vector $f \in \mathbb{R}^{|E|}$ forms the set of variables in this LP. The constraints are given to ensure that the set of 
	  solutions are the set of valid s-t flows. hence, a constraint on the flow conservation on f and the capacity maintanence on f. Hence, for the
	  given problem instance, the number of variables are polynomial in $|E|$ and $|V|$ and the number of constraints are also polynomial in $|E|$
	  and $|V|$. \\
	  
	  Sometimes, an alternative formulation of the LP is given for this problem. 
	  $$ \max \displaystyle\sum_{i \in P} f(i) - \lambda (\displaystyle\sum_{v \in V} F(v)) $$
	  subject to:
	  
	  \begin{itemize}
	   \item 
	      $\forall (j,k) \in E$  $\gamma((j,k)) \leq c((j,k))$
	   \item
	      $\forall i \in P$, 
		$$f(i) \leq F((j,k))~~~~~\forall (j,k) \in i$$
	   \item
	      
	   
	  \end{itemize}
